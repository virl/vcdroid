# vcdroid
VCDroid is ViewController library for Android which fixes Activities and Fragments by eliminating them from your app.

## Modal dialogs
You can easily show complex modal dialogs and dismiss them with returning results from any of child controllers in them.

Just use `presentController()` and `onPresentedDismissed()` methods in presenting controller and `dismissController()` in presented controller.
